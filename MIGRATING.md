## Migration Guides

### Migrating from versions < v1.5.0
#### Removed `Alamofire` dependecy, changed API methods

`Alamofire` networking manager removed from the SDK and related API methods removed too.<br/>
You should update `vgsCollect.submit(_:)` & `vgsCollect.submitFile(_:)` methods to `vgsCollect.sendData(_:)` & `vgsCollect.sendFile(_:)` accordingly. If you preferre to see new and old methods available together in same version, check `v1.4.2`.

Before:
```
vgsCollect.submit(path: "/post", method: .post, extraData: extraData, completion: { [weak self] (result, error) in
  if let data = result as? [String: Any] {
    //...
  }
})
```

Now:
```
vgsCollect.sendData(path: "/post", method: .post, extraData: extraData) { [weak self](result) in
  switch result {
    case .success(let code, let data, let response):
      if let data = data, let jsonData = try? JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: []) as? [String: Any] {
        //...
      }
      break
    case .failure(let code, let data, let response, let error):
        //...
      break
  }
}
```

Note that *completion* block also changed. Before `v1.5.0` you could get response data from *result* field in format `[String: Any]?`. Now response data is in `Data?` format, so you should convert it manually to the format you need. This allows us to handle any data type in response.<br/>
Before you could get some *error* objects as Alamofire's `AFError` type. Now you could get similar error types under the `NSURLErrorDomain` as `NSError`.

#### If you have issues with Cached `Alamofire` dependency
**Cocoapods** and **Carthage** cache project dependencies, so probably you will get errors when try to update `VGSCollectSDK` to the current version. Check the fix recommendations:

##### If you use Cocoapods:
Try to clean `DerivedData` folder for your project.<br/>
The location should look like: `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/your-project-id`.

##### If you use Carthage:
Carthage Caches usually stay at `~/Library/Caches/org.carthage.CarthageKit/dependencies/foobar`. You can remove  `Alamofire` dependencies there or follow the solution [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/2786).

Also remove `Alamofire` dependencies from your project's `Target`. Check targetsâ€™ `Build Phases/Run Scripts` and `General/Frameworks, Libraries, and Emdedded Content` tabs. 

### Migrating from versions < v1.3.5
#### Changed request data format for`.expDate` `FieldType`
We add divider `"/"` to input data by default when sending it to your *vault* from `VGSTextField` with `FieldType.expDate`

Before:
```
/// request body format example
{
  "customExpirationDateKey" : "0122"
}
```
Now:
```
/// request body format example
{
  "customExpirationDateKey" : "01/22"
}
```

Devider will be added by default. If you preferre to send data without divider, you can update textfield's  `VGSConfiguration.divider` attribute.<br/>
Send expiration date input without divider:
```
let expDateConfiguration = VGSConfiguration(collector: vgsCollect, fieldName: "customExpirationDateKey")
expDateConfiguration.type = .expDate
expDateConfiguration.divider = ""
```
